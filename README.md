Parallel Editor
===============
A real-time collaborative tool to develop files over the network.

Installation
============
To try out the brand new Parallel Eclipse Plugin for Eclipse Helios (3.6) add the following
update-site URL to the 'Install new Software' window in Eclipse:

and select the Parallel Editor Plugin.

The plugin is currently in version 0.0.1.beta3.

Basic Usage
===========
The plugin adds a contextual menu to your text editor under the name 'Share thru PE'.
It allows to create a local share or to connect to a remote server. It can share
any type of text editor including .java files.

It also adds two views that can be found in window/show view. The category for these
views is Parallel Editor. The two views are: Share and Chat. The first one
allows you to control your shares and remote connections while the second one
allows you to chat with your partners connected to your servers.
